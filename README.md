Handheld Video Game

Goals for this project:
0. Learn how to use EagleCAD to develop a PCB design for the project that will connect all hardware that the software is dependent on.
1. Write a bill of materials
2. Apply knowledge and understanding from online coursework and prior in-person coursework into an independent project. (interrupts, finite state machines, usage of GIT, interaction with an LCD display, interaction with analog devices and fundamentals of an RTOS)
3. Learn how the ESP32 microcontroller functions (and how it relates to the chosen board that I will be working with)
4. Develop drivers for SPI-controlled LCD/SD Card, I2C-controlled analog-to-digital converter, and GPIO devices connected to the board I am using
5. Consider using and learning how a specific RTOS works such as FreeRTOS
6. Develop a hand-held game via either baremetal firmware programming or code that will run on chosen RTOS (based on #4) utilizing what I did on a text-based high school project
